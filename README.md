# Welcome to LANDrive ðŸ–¥-ðŸ–¥-ðŸ–¥

This is a concurrent client server program that accomplishes file sharing and editing files between multiple users via TCP socket connections. 
        
1. Python Version:

   `3.12.3`

2. Packages used: 

   `PySide6 (pip install PySide6)`
   
   `pycryptodome (pip install pycryptodome)`
   
   `platformdirs (pip install platformdirs)`

4. Standard libraries that should already be installed:
  
    `datetime
    enum
    json
    os
    pathlib
    pickle
    platformdirs
    socket
    shutil
    struct
    sys
    tempfile
    threading
    time`


## File tree:

    LANDrive/
        client/
            __init__.py
            Upload.py
            UserInterface.py
            shared.py
            client.py
        server/
            FileDirectory/
                binary_test/
                    random.dll
                grocerylist.txt
                testfile.txt
            shared.py
            server.py

## How to run without password protection:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Ensure all the files are in the file tree noted above.
    
3. Run the server.py file
   * Must be done in the server/ directory!
    
5. Run the client.py file
   * Must be done in the client/ directory!
   * Insert 127.0.0.1 or localhost into the Host
   * Insert 8504 into the Port
   * Leave the password field blank


## How to run over LAN:
1. In server/server.py change HOST to the LAN IPv4 on device (ipconfig)

## How to run on a Rasberry PI
1. Coming soon!!!


## How to exit the program: 
    
1. client.py: 
   - Click the X in the top right corner of the program.
    
2. server.py:
    * Unfortunately, CTRL + C will not exit the python program.
        
    * Find the process id by doing ps -ef or by attempting to close the window.
    * Run kill [pid]. 

    * If that does not work, go into your task manager and end the python task process.


## Potential errors to note:

1. Not multithreaded:
   * Users manually have to refresh files.
   * Uploading/Downloading large files will cause the GUI to pause. 
    
3. Creating a directory must be unique. 
    
4. Spamming any buttons may cause the program to have issues. 

5. Making changes in the shared.py file must be copied to the client/ and server/ directories

6. Port 8504 might be in use.

## Flaws
1. Unfinished
2. Not multithreaded

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my professor, Dr. Sainju for his incredible teaching.
